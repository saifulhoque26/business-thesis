\begin{abstract}

In the recent years, we have seen success of \ac{IoT} technologies. Numerous machines, devices are getting connected to internet via sensors.Sensors produce data about machines, surroundings and different web/mobile applications make use of these data. With emergence of \ac{IoT} applications, Fog Computing came into place, which means running the application in micro datacenter near the sensor devices instead of cloud. There are several pioneer Fog Computing solutions are coming in the market, like cisco IOx, PRISMTECH's Vortex, Nebbiolo Fog Computing; but still there are not significant number of customers for any solutions. While in the institute Fraunhofer FOKUS we are developing a ``Programmable Fog Node" solution, I am following the design thinking methods to find a user segment's problem and lean startup methodology to get user feedback before we develop all the features. In this way, I want to develop a product that customers will want. 


%These data from sensors make value and different web/mobile applications are being developed to to make use of these data. The more different kind of devices are getting connected the more business opportunities are getting created.

 %connects machines to application. Sensors devices send the data to application and from the application we can control actuators (that controls devices). 
   
%Now, this middleware connect devices to application that run in the cloud. We are implementing a FOG node (a computer that runs locally, near the device) to run the application. In this way, sensor devices send data to application running in FOG node (Local computer). The application can make decision and send the action to actuator. We are developing a platform that will connect devices and applications in the FOG node.
   
%This will have various effects in the business model. The bandwidth cost will significantly reduces, because all the data don't need to be in the cloud. The Quality of Service (QoS) will improve for the application user. 
   
%Not only that, the industries can also be benefited if their machines can automatically perform some action based on the application.
